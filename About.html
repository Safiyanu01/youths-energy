    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <p>
      Youths Energy Organization is a non-profit Humanitarian organization
      located in Nigeria, West Africa with the primary aim of helping community
      development in Africa. Our stronghold is to combat poverty and help
      disadvantaged people living in deplorable conditions in Africa live a
      better life with access to basic amenities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have designed a model that is focused on alleviating poverty and
      improving quality of life. Our team will invest energy, time, skills, and
      resources to deliver both community and humanitarian projects to empower
      people and create change. Our strategy is unique and next to none in
      bringing People, Partners, and Resources together to develop a
      long-lasting positive change in Africa. Being a non-profit organization,
      we rely on donations to create sufficient opportunities for our volunteers
      needed to fulfill the desires and needs of communities in need. We assist
      the local craftsmen, fabric artists, and jewelry makers to sustain
      themselves and their families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Youths Energy Organization understands the challenges of single teenage
      mothers and supports them in selling their crafts to raise funds. We also
      focus on transforming agricultural conditions as well. To do so, we assist
      farmers in increasing their harvest and selling the produce in thriving
      markets. With consistent support and direct links to markets, we ensure
      these people get resources to lift themselves out of poor living
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are a non-profit organization which strives to improve the quality of
      life of people living in African rural communities. We address the needs
      and necessities of the needy to build healthy, sustainable and productive
      solutions for them through clean water, nutrition, agriculture and sports.
      Our mission is rebuilding life of the poors with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in promoting the realization of equality for poor people to
      facilitate their significant inclusion in all aspects of life. To achieve
      this, we welcome everyone interested in joining hands with us in carving a
      prosperous and fortunate world for communities living below the poverty
      line. Our vision is to make Africa a country where every needy enjoys
      equal access to the necessities and can achieve their full potential.
