      •Climate Action Hundreds of children are orphaned or abandoned and left
      hungry, homeless and without any opportunities for education. When child
      drop out of school, it becomes more difficult to reenter the school
      system. Out of school children are often forced to stay home and take up
      domestic chores, which exposes them to greater threats of domestic
      violence. However, when girls have access to education, they escape early
      pregnancy and marriage and are more likely to continue their education to
      higher levels. This, in turn, provides girls with the opportunities to
      fulfill their highest potential and become self-reliant. We are constantly
      seeking donors to sponsor childrens or less to take a good impact in
      education, school supplies, food & Clean Water. CLIMATE CRISIS We have
      been planting and planning to plant more in northern Nigerian States of
      Kano,Kaduna, jigawa,yobe,katsina, sokoto to Nigeria has the highest
      deforestation rate in the world, with only .36% of its primary forest
      remaining. Scientists believe planting 1.2 trillion trees (globally) would
      neutralize the damage caused by carbon emissions in the last decade.
      Please sponsor a child and Save a Life.

      •Health Care Mortality rates among children are high in many countries
      with many children as well as adults suffering and dying from heart
      disease, diabetes and cancer. There are only a handful of
      hospitals/medical centers in the country but the cost is exorbitant. The
      average family cannot afford the costs of medical care or surgery if
      needed. Save A Life assists in assisting with the medical expenses for
      heart surgeries, cancer treatments and other illnesses.
      Infra-Structure/Housing Many in these impoverished countries have many
      poor villages and communities. Large families live in small huts or
      dilapidated and unsafe houses. Currently, we are calling on Governments,
      NGO's to repair or build modest homes so that they can accommodate their
      families.

      •Homeless Children Generations upon generations, there is no end to the
      sight of young children of school age roaming the streets in a quest for
      survival. As an age-old tradition, these kids are popularly called
      ‘Almajiri’ – children from poor homes usually sent to Islamic boarding
      schools. Formal education remains a far cry for thousands of these
      children. (Almajiri were abandoned by their parents at Islamic centers.
      Almajiri are only allowed to study the Qu’ran and learn no employable
      skills - the result is over 80% of the terrorist group Boko Haram is
      ex-Almajiri.)
